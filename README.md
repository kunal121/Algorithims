## 2. Bubble Sort </br>
- Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in</br> order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is the number of items.</br>
